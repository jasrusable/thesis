\section{Background}
\paragraph{}
Personal digital consumer cameras have been with us for quite some time now. The rapid advancement of technology has led to the dramatic decrease in physical size of cameras as well as the rapid increase of image and lens quality, we carry high quality digital cameras with us every day in the form of our smart phone.

\paragraph{}
Digital surface models have become more and more prominent in recent years as the technology used for capturing data such as lidar has become more accessible and more feasible for the consumer. 

\paragraph{}
The purpose of this project is to try to resolve the position of a camera by comparing two different images taken from the same point in 2D against a digital surface model to obtain two lines in 2D which can then be intersected to obtain the position of the camera. A secondary purpose, assuming the primary purpose has been achieved, would be to investigate and compare the precisions and accuracies of the various different ways of positioning in outdoor and indoor situations. (such as resection, intersection, GPS fix, etc)

\paragraph{}
Programing will be done in C++ as this language is very popular and fast. C++ has a large community and has support in many popular libraries. OpenCV is one such library which will be made use of for this project. It is aimed mainly at real-time computer vision and has been under active development since 2000. 

\section{Problem Statement}
\paragraph{}
Can one reliably and accurately determine the location of an unknown position by comparing an image taken from that unknown point to a digital surface model? This would enable a person to be able to determine their position in space without the need for GPS, so this also has indoor applications as well.

\section{Objectives}
\paragraph{}
Be able to recognize the sides of a Rubik's cube using OpenCV.
