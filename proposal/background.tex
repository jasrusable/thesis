\section{Background}
\subsection{Cameras}
Personal digital consumer cameras have been with us for quite some time now. The rapid advancement of technology has led to the dramatic decrease in physical size of cameras as well as the rapid increase of image and lens quality during recent years. We carry high quality digital cameras with us every day in the form of our smart phone which can store hundreds of high quality images, and we can transmit and receive these photos effortlessly.

\subsection{Digital Surface Models}
\paragraph{}
Digital surface models have become more and more prominent in recent years as the technology used for capturing data such as lidar has become more accessible (faster scans, better scans) and feasible for the consumer and prosumer. Digital surface models are typically created using stereo analysis of images, contour analysis or from point clouds. Digital surface models are readily available in South Africa from the NGI.
