\section{Abstract}
The purpose of this project is to try to resolve the position of a camera by comparing images taken of objects 
against a digital surface model containing those objects.
A secondary purpose, assuming the primary purpose has been achieved, would be to investigate and compare the 
precisions and accuracies of the various different methods of positioning in outdoor and indoor scenarios 
(such as resection, intersection, GPS fix, etc).
An additional seconday purpose would be to determine and explore the applications of resolving position using 
the comparasion of images and digital surface models.
