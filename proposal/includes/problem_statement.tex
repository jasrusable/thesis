\section{Problem Statement}
The coordinates of an unknown point are to be resolved by taking multiple photographs form the 
unknown point of surrounding objects which will be represented in a digital surface model. 
This can be done in realtime using multiple cameras filming in different directions simultaneously, 
or by using multiple static images taken from the same unknown point.

\paragraph{}
 A program will need to be created in order to match the images of the objects to the objects 
 mapped on the digital surface model. 
 By doing this, lines/planes will be resolved in the coordinate system of the digital surface 
 model upon which the cameras location will lie.
 These lines/planes should intersect on the point where the camera was located when the photographs were taken.
