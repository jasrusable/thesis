\section{Abstract}
The purpose of this project is to try to resolve the position of a camera by comparing images taken of objects against a digital surface model containing those objects to obtain lines in 2D which can then be intersected to obtain the position of the camera. A secondary purpose, assuming the primary purpose has been achieved, would be to investigate and compare the precisions and accuracies of the various different methods of positioning in outdoor and indoor scenarios (such as resection, intersection, GPS fix, etc). An additional purpose would be to determine and explore the applications of resolving position using imagery and digital surface models.
