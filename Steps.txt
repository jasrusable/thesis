Steps:
1.) Obatain 3D model of an environment.
2.) Obtain a source image which is an image of a scene within the environment.
3.) Create an image sequence from the model.
	Notes:
		1. Blender has the ability to create image sequences from an animation of a model.
	Assumptions:
		1. The image sequance should be about a single point in the model.
		2. The source image should be taken from the same point as where the image sequnce was generated from.
4.) Use OpenCV to compare the source image to the images in the image sequence.
	Notes:
		1. Which OpenCV function will be used to compare the source image to the images in the sequence?
			- Template matching 
				- A template needs to be provided for comparason.
			- Feature matching
				- This is more promising.

	Issues:
		1. Source image and images from the sequance are already taken from the same point.
