\section{Methodology}

The most critical component of of this project is to be able to match identify objects in an image and be able to identify the same object on a digital surface model. I will attempt to solve this problem on a small scale initially. I plan to create a $m^3$ cardboard box which will contain a coordinate system on the inside, then I will place a regular object in a defined space in this box and create a digital surface model to reflect the scenario. Then, using a webcam and some programming I will try to determine the line from the camera to the object in the coordinate system.

\paragraph{}
Programing will be done in C++ as this language is very popular and fast. C++ has a large community and has support in many popular libraries. OpenCV is one such library which will be made use of for this project. OpenCV is aimed mainly at real-time computer vision and has been under active development since 2000. OpenCV has support for many different programming languages such as C, C++, Pyhton and Java. OpenCV is also capable of running on mobile operating systems Andriod and iOS, so there is a possibility of extending the outcomes of this project into the mobile app market.
