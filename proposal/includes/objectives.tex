\section{Objectives}
\subsection{Primary Objective}
Be able to match an image contain objects to a digital surface model containing those same objects in 
order to resolve a line/plane in 2D along/in which that camera lay at the time of photography.
Then, obtain multiple lines/planes from multiple images and perform an intersection to resolve the 
coordinates of the camera in the digital surface model's coordinate system.

\subsection{Secondary Objectives}

\subsubsection{Effects of objects used in matching/recognition process}
Investigate effects of distance from camera to objects, relative size of objects, number of distinct 
objects, shape of objects

\subsubsection{Effects of surface model}
Investigate effects of different accuracies/precisions of surface models as well as different camera qualities.

\subsubsection{Compression of obtainable precisions and accuracies}
Compare the accuracies and precisions of using the above mentioned positioning technique to other popular 
positioning techniques (GPS, Intersection, Resection, GSM Intersection etc).

\subsubsection{Applications}
Investigate applications of using the above mentioned positioning technique.
