\section{Methodology}

The most critical component of this project is to be able to identify objects in an image and be able to match 
the same objects on a digital surface model, thus providing a plane on which the unknown point will lie on.


\paragraph{}
Programing will be done in C++ as this language is very popular and fast. C++ has a large community and has support 
in many popular libraries. OpenCV is one such library which will be made use of for this project.
OpenCV is aimed mainly at real-time computer vision and has been under active development since 2000. 
OpenCV has support for many different programming languages such as C, C++, Pyhton and Java. 
OpenCV is also capable of running on mobile operating systems Andriod and iOS, so there is a possibility
 of extending the outcomes of this project into the mobile app market.
