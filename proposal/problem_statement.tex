\section{Problem Statement}
The coordinates of an unknown point are to be resolved by taking multiple photographs form the unknown point of surrounding objects which will be represented in a digital surface model. A program will need to be created in order to match the images of the objects to the objects mapped on the digital surface model. By doing this, lines will be resolved in the coordinate system of the digital surface model, these lines should intersect where the camera was located when taking the photographs, this should provide a coordinate estimate of where the camera was when the photographs were taken.
