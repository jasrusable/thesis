\section{Questions}

Can one reliably and accurately determine the location of an unknown position by comparing images of objects taken from that unknown point to a digital surface model containing and reflecting those objects in it? This would enable a person to be able to determine the position of a camera in space without the need for GPS, this may also have real-time and indoor applications.
